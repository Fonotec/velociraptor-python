VELOCIraptor Python Toolkit Documentation
=========================================

VELOCIraptor-Python is a python toolkit for reading VELOCIraptor
outputs, with a particular focus on integration with the
SWIFT cosmological simulation code.

It allows for automatic association of symbolic units (using unyt)
with halo properties, extraction of individual haloes to a
SWIFTsimIO dataset, and includes tools to help create both
publication-ready and quick figures.
